    When $\eta$ is lower, the nominal wage is less responsive to the real economic developments ($x_{t}$ and, thus, $A_{t}$). Given that the less flexible salary will make firms less profitable for any given negative productivity shock compared to the old setting with higher $eta$, the firm will decrease its vacancy posting (since it has lower profit), thus resulting in higher unemployment than the old setting. The case of the positive productivity shock is symmetric which will decrease unemployment more than the old setting, thus resulting in higher unemployment volatility.
